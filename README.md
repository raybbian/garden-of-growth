# Garden of Growth

This repository contains the files for my personal portfolio, which is still
under construction. I've started this place to remind myself to constantly grow,
as well as provide myself with a snapshot of how far I've come.

## Inspiration

I remember seeing this video on the Wave Function Collapse - and it was one of
the major sources of inspiration for my interest in Computer Science.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SuvO4Gi7uY. I wanted to use this algorithm for
my project because it allows for the generation of unique ideas and places based
on core and fixed attributes.

The following image was generated to use for inspiration:
